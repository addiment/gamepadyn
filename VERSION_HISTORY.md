# Version History


## v0.3.0-BETA
~~This will be the last version of Gamepadyn before my team's competition (assuming I finish it before then).~~
There's no way all of this is going to be done in 2 days.
Sorry, Gamepadyn fans. ðŸ’” <!-- (the joke is that there aren't any) -->

### Goals & Ideas
- Introduce a separate API (events relating to `Gamepadyn` instead of to the `Player`) for listening to actions without caring about the player who performed the action.
  - Currently, the lack of such an API increases implementation overhead,
  example at the end of this section
  - Player information is still useful, even in the context of player-specific events,
  so the event API should be passing a `Player` as a parameter to the callback.
    - This would mean that the "classic" `it()` will need to be adjusted
  - 
- Rename some of the `getEvent()` overloads to better represent what they actually do (i.e. `addEventListener`)
- Currently, the default `ActionBind` will overwrite the action's value if the input is the same type as the output. Ideally, this would be a parameter, so that multiple actions could operate at the same time.
  - This could also be solved simply creating a CommonBind that

This is what we have right now:
```kotlin
// This is real code, from our primary implementation (aka. the FTC #5741 RoboHawks robot)
val openLeftClaw =      { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) leftOpen = true }
val closeLeftClaw =     { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) leftOpen = false }
val openRightClaw =     { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) rightOpen = true }
val closeRightClaw =    { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) rightOpen = false }

gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN,     openLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN,     openLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE,    closeLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE,    closeLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN,    openRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN,    openRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE,   closeRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE,   closeRightClaw)
```

This is the code we want to have.

```kotlin
gamepadyn.addGlobalEventListener(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN)    { if (data()) leftOpen    = true  }
gamepadyn.addGlobalEventListener(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE)   { if (data()) leftOpen    = false }
gamepadyn.addGlobalEventListener(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN)   { if (data()) rightOpen   = true  }
gamepadyn.addGlobalEventListener(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE)  { if (data()) rightOpen   = false }
```

## v0.2.0-BETA
There are probably a lot of things I missed, I don't usually work on codebases of this size, and I've just made so many changes.
- Completely reworked the project to provide near 100% compile-time type checking.
  - This makes everything significantly less error prone,
  - In Kotlin, this makes use significantly more convenient, concise, and intuitive.
    - In Java, this does nothing (sorry not sorry).
      - More specifically, due to type erasure on the JVM,
      overloaded methods with generic arguments require separate names.
      This makes the Java version of the API almost identical what it was previously (but hey, if you're using Gamepadyn in Java, you probably don't like change anyways).
      Despite having different names, both APIs still have type checking.
      - The largest concern with this change is that Java and Kotlin have *different* APIs, which makes porting code harder.
      - The benefits for Kotlin outweigh the downsides for Java (and I am very biased)
- The order of the `ActionBind` constructor has been flipped.
This is somewhat of a small and annoying change,
but the goal is readability. *Putting the action first*
makes understanding a configuration miles easier.

## v0.1.1-BETA
NOTE: this version never made it to main. Most of the changes were adapted to work for the 0.2.0 BETA, and the version number was slightly misleading. 
- Added shorthand for `ActionEvent.addListener` using the `invoke` operator.
  - In Kotlin, `ActionEvent.addListener { /* ... */ }` can now be called with `ActionEvent { /* ... */ }`.
  - See the README for an updated example.
- Added shorthand for `InputData` using the `invoke` and `get` operators.
  - The intent of this change was to make raw input data easier to access.
- Renamed `ActionEvent.addJListener` to `ActionEvent.addListener` to remain in line with its Kotlin API counterpart. 
- Added error messages to all assertions.
- `JavaThunks` has been reworked. I am not satisfied with the current state, but haven't yet thought of a way to improve it.
  - Notably, you are no longer required to make a map separately from initialization, and can use the `Gamepadyn` constructor with `vararg` instead.
- Added factory methods to `InputDescriptor` (aka. `GDesc`), replacing the constructor which has previously led to some issues with default arguments.
  - The intent of this change was to prevent accidentally calling the constructor with invalid arguments that can't be checked at compile time without an annotation processor.
  - Calling `InputDescriptor` with `(DIGITAL, 1)` or `(ANALOG)` is far too easy, leading to runtime errors. `GDesc.digital()` and `GDesc.analog()` are able to state most requirements at compile-time.

### Goals

- Make it harder to get references to things that shouldn't have references taken of
- Enforce more compile-time constraints

## v0.1.0-BETA

- First version!
