# Version History


## v0.3.0-BETA
~~This will be the last version of Gamepadyn before my team's competition (assuming I finish it before then).~~
There's no way all of this is going to be done in 2 days.
Sorry, Gamepadyn fans. ðŸ’” <!-- (the joke is that there aren't any) -->

- Completely reworked the binding API again!
It's really, _**REALLY**_ complicated, so documentation is WIP.
  - It's entirely type-safe 
  - It's data-driven and it's serializable
  - It's highly extensible (but less extensible than the previous API by design)
  - It's not really using the builder pattern, but that's the closest comparison 
- Introduced a separate API (events relating to `Gamepadyn` instead of to the `Player`)
for listening to actions without caring about the player who performed the action.
  - This significantly reduces implementation overhead.
  of which has since been removed.
- Changed the parameter type for events on event listeners to the new `Event.EventData` type.
  - It contains a field for the same data that was held by the parameter previously
  - It also contains a 
- Most signatures `Player.getEvent()` have been renamed to `addListener()` to better represent
what they actually do (aka. add a listener)
- `InputDataAnalog2` can no longer be constructed with a single argument (0 or 2 are still OK)
  - This is to ensure it isn't being used in place of an analog1

This is how it used to be:

```kotlin
// This is real code, from our primary implementation (aka. the FTC #5741 RoboHawks robot)
val openLeftClaw =      { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) leftOpen = true }
val closeLeftClaw =     { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) leftOpen = false }
val openRightClaw =     { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) rightOpen = true }
val closeRightClaw =    { it: InputDataDigital -> if (it()) rightOpen = false }

gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN,     openLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN,     openLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE,    closeLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE,    closeLeftClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN,    openRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN,    openRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[0].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE,   closeRightClaw)
gamepadyn.players[1].getEvent(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE,   closeRightClaw)
```

This is how it is now:

```kotlin
gamepadyn.addGlobalListener(CLAW_LEFT_OPEN)    { if (it.data()) leftOpen    = true  }
gamepadyn.addGlobalListener(CLAW_LEFT_CLOSE)   { if (it.data()) leftOpen    = false }
gamepadyn.addGlobalListener(CLAW_RIGHT_OPEN)   { if (it.data()) rightOpen   = true  }
gamepadyn.addGlobalListener(CLAW_RIGHT_CLOSE)  { if (it.data()) rightOpen   = false }
```

## v0.2.0-BETA
There are probably a lot of things I missed, I don't usually work on codebases of this size,
and I've just made so many changes.
- Completely reworked the project to provide near 100% compile-time type checking.
  - This makes everything significantly less error prone,
  - In Kotlin, this makes use significantly more convenient, concise, and intuitive.
    - In Java, this does nothing (sorry not sorry).
      - More specifically, due to type erasure on the JVM,
      overloaded methods with generic arguments require separate names.
      This makes the Java version of the API almost identical what it was previously
      (but hey, if you're using Gamepadyn in Java, you probably don't like change anyways).
      Despite having different names, both APIs still have type checking.
      - The largest concern with this change is that Java and Kotlin have *different* APIs,
      which makes porting code harder.
      - The benefits for Kotlin outweigh the downsides for Java (and I am very biased)
- The order of the `ActionBind` constructor has been flipped.
This is somewhat of a small and annoying change,
but the goal is readability. *Putting the action first*
makes understanding a configuration miles easier.
- Backends must now provide timing information, accessible by `ActionBind`s.

## v0.1.1-BETA
NOTE: this version never made it to main. Most of the changes were adapted to work for 
the 0.2.0 BETA, and the version number was slightly misleading. 
- Added shorthand for `ActionEvent.addListener` using the `invoke` operator.
  - In Kotlin, `ActionEvent.addListener { /* ... */ }` can now be called with
  `ActionEvent { /* ... */ }`.
  - See the README for an updated example.
- Added shorthand for `InputData` using the `invoke` and `get` operators.
  - The intent of this change was to make raw input data easier to access.
- Renamed `ActionEvent.addJListener` to `ActionEvent.addListener` to remain in line with
its Kotlin API counterpart. 
- Added error messages to all assertions.
- `JavaThunks` has been reworked. I am not satisfied with the current state,
but haven't yet thought of a way to improve it.
  - Notably, you are no longer required to make a map separately from initialization,
  and can use the `Gamepadyn` constructor with `vararg` instead.
- Added factory methods to `InputDescriptor` (aka. `GDesc`),
replacing the constructor which has previously led to some issues with default arguments.
  - The intent of this change was to prevent accidentally calling the constructor with
  invalid arguments that can't be checked at compile time without an annotation processor.
  - Calling `InputDescriptor` with `(DIGITAL, 1)` or `(ANALOG)` is far too easy,
  leading to runtime errors. `GDesc.digital()` and `GDesc.analog()` are able to state most
  requirements at compile-time.

### Goals

- Make it harder to get references to things that shouldn't have references taken of
- Enforce more compile-time constraints

## v0.1.0-BETA

- First version!
