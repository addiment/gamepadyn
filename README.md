# Architecture

In Gamepadyn,
game controllers are represented as instances of the `Player` class.
A `Player` holds a `Configuration` object,
which are effectively a map of Actions to `ActionBind`s.
`ActionBind`s are functions which transform `InputData` generated by the input backend.
The Action's data type must match that of the return value of the `ActionBind`

# Goals & Non-Goals

Gamepadyn does not try to do everything.
If it tried, it would be impossibly difficult to develop and maintain,
and it would be awful to actually use.

## Goals

- Provide more ways of compile-time validation
  - We may change the `Gamepadyn` class and its children to take 3 type templates instead of 1: one for a supertype and the others for analog and digital subtypes.
- Provide more pre-made `ActionBind` transformations to prevent rewriting code
